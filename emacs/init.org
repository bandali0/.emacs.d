;;; init.el --- Amin Bandali's Emacs config -*- lexical-binding: t ; eval: (view-mode 1)-*-

Enable =view-mode=, which both makes the file read-only (as a reminder
that =init.el= is an auto-generated file, not supposed to be edited),
and provides some convenient key bindings for browsing through the
