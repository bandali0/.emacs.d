Use [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the config for each package to their corresponding folder. For instance, `stow vim`.

GTK Theme: [Numix-Tomorrow](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/numix-themes-tomorrow/)

*P.S.* do NOT stow `other`, as it's not meant to be copied/symlinked in the home folder.
