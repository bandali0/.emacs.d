* About

This org file contains the configuration files of pretty much every
program I use. The files are tangled (i.e. exported, or derived) from
this file using =org-babel=.

Note: This file is best viewed inside Emacs with org mode.

* Configs

This section contains the configuration files (dotfiles) of various
programs I use.

* Scripts

This section contains various useful scripts and the ones used by the
programs above. For instance, =toggle-tablet= for switching to and
from tablet mode on my X220T, =toggle-presentation-mode= for toggling
Xfce's presentation mode which keeps the screen awake, and
=rofi-light= a small utility that uses [[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi][Rofi]] to ask and [[https://github.com/haikarainen/light][light]] to set an
exact brightness value.
