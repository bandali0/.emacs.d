* About

This org file contains the configuration files of pretty much every
program I use. The files are tangled (i.e. exported, or derived) from
this file using =org-babel=.

Note: This file is best viewed inside Emacs with org mode.

* Configs

This section contains the configuration files (dotfiles) of various
programs I use.

# An example configuration file for MPD.
# Read the user manual for documentation: http://www.musicpd.org/doc/user/


# Files and directories #######################################################
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database. This 
# setting defaults to the XDG directory, otherwise the music directory will be
# be disabled and audio files will only be accepted over ipc socket (using
# file:// protocol) or streaming files over an accepted protocol.
#
music_directory		"~/usr/music"
#
# This setting sets the MPD internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by MPD. The server will use 
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the MPD
# format. This setting defaults to playlist saving being disabled.
#
playlist_directory		"~/.mpd/playlists"
#
# This setting sets the location of the MPD database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the 
# server is not up. This setting defaults to disabled which will allow
# MPD to accept files over ipc socket (using file:// protocol) or streaming
# files over an accepted protocol.
#
db_file			"~/.mpd/database"
# 
# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
# These logs are great for troubleshooting, depending on your log_level
# settings.
#
# The special value "syslog" makes MPD use the local syslog daemon. This
# setting defaults to logging to syslog, otherwise logging is disabled.
#
log_file			"~/.mpd/log"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of mpd --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default and the pid file will not be stored.
#
pid_file			"~/.mpd/pid"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get MPD back into the same general shape it was in before
# it was brought down. This setting is disabled by default and the server 
# state will be reset on server start up.
#
state_file			"~/.mpd/state"
#
# The location of the sticker database.  This is a database which
# manages dynamic information attached to songs.
#
sticker_file			"~/.mpd/sticker.sql"

# General music daemon options ################################################
#
# This setting specifies the user that MPD will run as. MPD should never run as
# root and you may use this setting to make MPD change its user ID after
# initialization. This setting is disabled by default and MPD is run as the
# current user.
#
#user				"nobody"
#
# This setting specifies the group that MPD will run as. If not specified
# primary group of user specified with "user" setting will be used (if set).
# This is useful if MPD needs to be a member of group such as "audio" to
# have permission to use sound card.
#
#group				"nogroup"
#
# This setting sets the address for the daemon to listen on. Careful attention
# should be paid if this is assigned to anything other then the default, any.
# This setting can deny access to control of the daemon. Not effective if
# systemd socket activiation is in use.
#
# For network
#bind_to_address		"any"
#
# And for Unix Socket
#bind_to_address		"~/.mpd/socket"
#
# This setting is the TCP port that is desired for the daemon to get assigned
# to.
#
#port				"6600"
#
# This setting controls the type of information which is logged. Available 
# setting arguments are "default", "secure" or "verbose". The "verbose" setting
# argument is recommended for troubleshooting, though can quickly stretch
# available resources on limited hardware storage.
#
#log_level			"default"
#
# If you have a problem with your MP3s ending abruptly it is recommended that 
# you set this argument to "no" to attempt to fix the problem. If this solves
# the problem, it is highly recommended to fix the MP3 files with vbrfix
# (available from <http://www.willwap.co.uk/Programs/vbrfix.php>), at which
# point gapless MP3 playback can be enabled.
#
#gapless_mp3_playback			"yes"
#
# Setting "restore_paused" to "yes" puts MPD into pause mode instead
# of starting playback after startup.
#
#restore_paused "no"
#
# This setting enables MPD to create playlists in a format usable by other
# music players.
#
#save_absolute_paths_in_playlists	"no"
#
# This setting defines a list of tag types that will be extracted during the
# audio file discovery process. The complete list of possible values can be
# found in the user manual.
#metadata_to_use	"artist,album,title,track,name,genre,date,composer,performer,disc"
#
# This setting enables automatic update of MPD's database when files in 
# music_directory are changed.
#
#auto_update	"yes"
#
# Limit the depth of the directories being watched, 0 means only watch
# the music directory itself.  There is no limit by default.
#
#auto_update_depth "3"

# Symbolic link behavior ######################################################
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", MPD will discover audio files by following 
# symbolic links outside of the configured music_directory.
#
#follow_outside_symlinks	"yes"
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", MPD will discover audio files by following
# symbolic links inside of the configured music_directory.

# Normalization automatic volume adjustments ##################################
#
# This setting specifies the type of ReplayGain to use. This setting can have
# the argument "off", "album", "track" or "auto". "auto" is a special mode that
# chooses between "track" and "album" depending on the current state of
# random playback. If random playback is enabled then "track" mode is used.
# See <http://www.replaygain.org> for more details about ReplayGain.
# This setting is off by default.
#
#replaygain			"album"
#
# This setting sets the pre-amp used for files that have ReplayGain tags. By
# default this setting is disabled.
#
#replaygain_preamp		"0"
#
# This setting sets the pre-amp used for files that do NOT have ReplayGain tags.
# By default this setting is disabled.
#
#replaygain_missing_preamp	"0"
#
# This setting enables or disables ReplayGain limiting.
# MPD calculates actual amplification based on the ReplayGain tags
# and replaygain_preamp / replaygain_missing_preamp setting.
# If replaygain_limit is enabled MPD will never amplify audio signal
# above its original level. If replaygain_limit is disabled such amplification
# might occur. By default this setting is enabled.
#
#replaygain_limit		"yes"
#
# This setting enables on-the-fly normalization volume adjustment. This will

##### directories ######
##
## Directory for storing ncmpcpp related files.
## Changing it is useful if you want to store
## everything somewhere else and provide command
## line setting for alternative location to config
## file which defines that while launching ncmpcpp.
##
#
ncmpcpp_directory = ~/.ncmpcpp
#
##
## Directory for storing downloaded lyrics. It
## defaults to ~/.lyrics since other MPD clients
## (eg. ncmpc) also use that location.
##
#
#lyrics_directory = ~/.lyrics
#
##### connection settings #####
#
#mpd_host = localhost
#
#mpd_port = 6600
#
#mpd_connection_timeout = 5
#
## Needed for tag editor and file operations to work.
##
mpd_music_dir = ~/usr/music
#
#mpd_crossfade_time = 5
#
##### music visualizer #####
##
## Note: In order to make music visualizer work you'll
## need to use mpd fifo output, whose format parameter
## has to be set to 44100:16:1 for mono visualization
## or 44100:16:2 for stereo visualization. Example
## configuration (it has to be put into mpd.conf):
##
## audio_output {
##        type            "fifo"
##        name            "Visualizer feed"
##        path            "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
##        format          "44100:16:2"
## }
##
#
visualizer_fifo_path = /tmp/mpd.fifo
#
##
## Note: Below parameter is needed for ncmpcpp
## to determine which output provides data for
## visualizer and thus allow syncing between
## visualization and sound as currently there
## are some problems with it.
##
#
visualizer_output_name = my fifo
#
##
## If you set format to 44100:16:2, make it 'yes'.
##
visualizer_in_stereo = yes
#
##
## Multiply received samples by given value. Very
## useful for proper visualization of quiet music.
##
#visualizer_sample_multiplier = 1
#
##
## Note: Below parameter defines how often ncmpcpp
## has to "synchronize" visualizer and audio outputs.
## 30 seconds is optimal value, but if you experience
## synchronization problems, set it to lower value.
## Keep in mind that sane values start with >=10.
##
#
visualizer_sync_interval = 30
#
##
## Note: To enable spectrum frequency visualization
## you need to compile ncmpcpp with fftw3 support.
##
#
## Available values: spectrum, wave, wave_filled, ellipse.
##
visualizer_type = spectrum
#
#visualizer_look = ●▮
visualizer_look = "●•"
#
#visualizer_color = blue, cyan, green, yellow, magenta, red
#
## Alternative subset of 256 colors for terminals that support it.
##
#visualizer_color = 41, 83, 119, 155, 185, 215, 209, 203, 197, 161
#
##### system encoding #####
##
## ncmpcpp should detect your charset encoding
## but if it failed to do so, you can specify
## charset encoding you are using here.
##
## Note: You can see whether your ncmpcpp build
## supports charset detection by checking output
## of `ncmpcpp --version`.
##
## Note: Since MPD uses UTF-8 by default, setting
## this option makes sense only if your encoding
## is different.
##
#
#system_encoding = ""
#
##### delays #####
#
## Time of inactivity (in seconds) after playlist
## highlighting will be disabled (0 = always on).
##
#playlist_disable_highlight_delay = 5
#
## Defines how long messages are supposed to be visible.
##
#message_delay_time = 5
#
##### song format #####
##
## For a song format you can use:
##
## %l - length
## %f - filename
## %D - directory
## %a - artist
## %A - album artist
## %t - title
## %b - album
## %y - date
## %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
## %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
## %g - genre
## %c - composer
## %p - performer
## %d - disc
## %C - comment
## %P - priority
## $R - begin right alignment
##
## If you want to make sure that a part of the format is displayed
## only when certain tags are present, you can archieve it by
## grouping them with brackets, e.g. '{%a - %t}' will be evaluated
## to 'ARTIST - TITLE' if both tags are present or '' otherwise.
## It is also possible to define a list of alternatives by providing
## several groups and separating them with '|', e.g. '{%t}|{%f}'
## will be evaluated to 'TITLE' or 'FILENAME' if the former is not
## present.
##
## Note: If you want to set limit on maximal length of a tag, just
## put the appropriate number between % and character that defines
## tag type, e.g. to make album take max. 20 terminal cells, use '%20b'.
##
## In addition, formats support markers used for text attributes.
## They are followed by character '$'. After that you can put:
##
## - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
## - 1 - black
## - 2 - red
## - 3 - green
## - 4 - yellow
## - 5 - blue
## - 6 - magenta
## - 7 - cyan
## - 8 - white
## - 9 - end of current color
## - b - bold text
## - u - underline text
## - r - reverse colors
## - a - use alternative character set
##
## If you don't want to use a non-color attribute anymore, just put it
## again, but this time insert character '/' between '$' and attribute
## character, e.g. {$b%t$/b}|{$r%f$/r} will display bolded title tag
## or filename with reversed colors.
##
## If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats
## (the naming scheme is described below in section about color
## definitions), it can be done with the syntax $(COLOR), e.g. to set
## the artist tag to one of the non-standard colors and make it have

## Note: Below variables are used for sorting songs in browser.
## The sort mode determines how songs are sorted, and can be used

#
##### columns settings #####
##
## syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."
##
## - syntax for each column is:
##
## (width of the column)[color of the column]{displayed tag}
##
## Note: Width is by default in %, if you want a column to
## have fixed size, add 'f' after the value, e.g. (10)[white]{a}
## will be the column that take 10% of screen (so the real width
## will depend on actual screen size), whereas (10f)[white]{a}
## will take 10 terminal cells, no matter how wide the screen is.
##
## - color is optional (if you want the default one,
##   leave the field empty).
##
## Note: You can give a column additional attributes by putting appropriate
## character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
##
## - r - column will be right aligned
## - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed
##
## You can also:
##
## - give a column custom name by putting it after attributes,
##   separated with character ':', e.g. {lr:Length} gives you
##   right aligned column of lengths named "Length".
##
## - define sequence of tags, that have to be displayed in case
##   predecessor is empty in a way similar to the one in classic
##   song format, i.e. using '|' character, e.g. {a|c|p:Owner}
##   creates column named "Owner" that tries to display artist
##   tag and then composer and performer if previous ones are
##   not available.
##
#

##### colors definitions #####
##
## It is possible to set a background color by setting a color
## value "<foreground>_<background>", e.g. red_black will set
## foregound color to red and background color to black.
##
## In addition, for terminals that support 256 colors it
## is possible to set one of them by using a number in range
## [1, 256] instead of color name, e.g. numerical value
## corresponding to red_black is 2_1. To find out if the
## terminal supports 256 colors, run ncmpcpp and check out
## the bottom of the help screen for list of available colors
## and their numerical values.
##
## Note: due to technical limitations of ncurses, if 256 colors
## are used, it is possible to either use only the colors with
## default background color, or all pairs from 1_1 up to 254_127,
## depending on the ncurses version used.

# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Valid values are "always" (default), "never", "multiple"
# With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.

* Scripts

This section contains various useful scripts and the ones used by the
programs above. For instance, =toggle-tablet= for switching to and
from tablet mode on my X220T, =toggle-presentation-mode= for toggling
Xfce's presentation mode which keeps the screen awake, and
=rofi-light= a small utility that uses [[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi][Rofi]] to ask and [[https://github.com/haikarainen/light][light]] to set an
exact brightness value.

This script toggles between a 'normal' mode and a 'tablet' mode, doing
a few things:

- rotates the screen using =xrandr=, so that rotating the physical
  display of my X220t would have the laptop's battery on the right
  hand side,
- enables touch screen,
- properly rotates the stylus pen and touch screen pointers, and
- toggles between RGB and Vertical BGR sub-pixel order.
